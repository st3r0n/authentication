FOR PASSWORD BASED LOGINS
1. username enumeration bu different response ----> found mainly when invalid username changes to invalid passsword ehrn username is found
2. look at the response code in intruder 
3. look at response timing when attacking a paramter try to redo tha attack
4. ip block --> sometimes X-Forwarded-for can help 
somtimes a valid credential can help reset the ip block so we can use our valid credential in between the dicktionary like every 4th or 5th one
